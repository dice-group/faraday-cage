## Enrichment operator
An operator which takes at least one dataset as input and returns at least one enriched version as output
is called *enrichment operator*.
We call enrichment operators that take and return exactly one dataset * **normal** enrichment operators*, while
those accepting or emitting many datasets are called * **hub** enrichment operators*.
