## What it is

- Kickstart your own highly configurable modular application
- Facilities for declaring and implementing atomic units of computation (dubbed execution nodes)
- Declarative configuration language to arrange these execution nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) dubbed the execution graph

## Features

- Declarative definition of data flow in [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/)
- Simple and easy collection of interfaces to implement
- Extensible by design (plugin system with [PF4J](https://pf4j.org))
- Validation, Documentation and Frontend Generation enabled through extensive use of [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/)
